Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& a) {
        //int zeroes=0,ones=0,twos=0;
  int n=a.size();
        int low=0;
        int high=n-1;
        int i=0;
        while(i<=high)
        {
            if(a[i]==0)
            {
                swap(a[low],a[i]);
                i++;
                low++;
            }
            else
            if(a[i]==2)
            {
                swap(a[high],a[i]);
                high--;
            }
            else
                i++;
        }
    }
};
